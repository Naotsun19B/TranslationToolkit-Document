## Description

This plugin can translate text and tooltips in the Unreal Engine editor and display the results in a pop-up window.    
It also has the ability to translate the selected text and replace it with the translation result.  

## Requirement

Target version : UE4.27 ï½ž 5.6  
Target platform : Windows    

UE4.25 can only use Libre Translate and Microsoft Translator as a translation engine and cannot read aloud.  

## Installation  

Install from the [marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en/product/translation-toolkit).  
If the feature is not available after installing the plugin, it is possible that the plugin has not been enabled, so please check if the plugin is enabled from Edit > Plugins.

## Features And Usages

### Translate

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/183342098-c2a65691-2401-46e0-8859-811baf1c00c1.mp4

The default shortcut key is ```Shift + Ctrl + Z```, which translates the text under the mouse pointer and displays the result in a pop-up window.  

![SimpleTranslationPanel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/183342196-a25ce597-0f13-4f8f-bc2b-87929a1bd3b4.PNG)

Use the speaker buttons to read out the source and target text. (If the language is not supported, you will not be able to press the button.)    
The combo box next to the speaker button allows you to set the source and destination languages.  
Press the pin button in the upper right corner to view the results in the translation panel described below.    
This pop-up window will be automatically closed by clicking anywhere other than the window.  

### Translate And Replace

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/183342242-446034f7-c05b-46d4-b1c9-d5f78db560d5.mp4

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/183342269-fce16ad9-0f63-4f18-aabe-99b6eebe886e.mp4

The default shortcut key is ```Shift + Ctrl + X```, which translates the currently selected text and replaces it with the result.    
When used with text that does not contain line breaks, such as function or variable names, you can choose the format to replace them with.    
It is also possible to make the selector UI to choose the language to be translated into appear before the translation from the plugin settings described below.    

### Translate Tooltip

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/183342335-3c5eaa17-2407-40f4-acb3-7d81941adb70.mp4

The default shortcut key is ```Shift + Ctrl + C```, which translates the currently displayed tooltip and replaces it with the result.    
The translation result will be kept until the tooltip is closed.    
You can also choose to display the results in a pop-up window similar to the text in the editor from the plugin settings described below.  

### Read Aloud Text

The default shortcut key is ```Shift + Ctrl + V```, which will read out the text under the mouse pointer.  

### Open Advanced Translation Panel

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/183342413-270417d3-6968-4fb7-9094-88b0a46e1ba5.mp4

The default shortcut key is not assigned. If you assign it, you will be able to see the translation panel.  

![OpenTranslationPanelMenu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/183342454-cf985a4c-a5db-43d4-afd2-973e5b4a5514.PNG)

The translation panel can be displayed from the Window menu at the top of the level editor.  

![AdvancedTranslationPanel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/183342487-9be57407-e625-4fcf-b839-e5d447bf8f47.PNG)

Basically, it is the same as the pop-up window, but the translation panel has some additional features.

| **Button**         | **Function**                                                                        |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recycle bin button | Return the translation panel to its empty state.                                    |
| History button     | Display the list of translation history and show the selected history in the panel. |
| Copy button        | Copy the translated text to the clipboard.                                          |

Also, if the spelling or source language is wrong, suggestions for improvement will be displayed at the bottom of the panel, and clicking on the link will correct the spelling or source language.
